| Syntax      | Meaning |  Further explanation | 
| :---        |    :----:   | :----: | 
| ``(f|g)``   | `f` is the random variable and `g` is the group variable    | each `f` has `g` levels | 
| ``(1|g)``      | Random group intercept       |  |

# Example: 
```{r}
#Load package
library(glmmTMB)
# Simulate data to illustrate 
n = 10
x <- rnorm(n); y <- x + rnorm(n)
g= factor(1:n)
data = data.frame(x,y,g)

# Fit model
glmmTMB(y ~ x, data=data) 
# this model has fixed effects only: intercept and the slopes are estimated
# we could have been fit this model easily with lm function in R 

#Now lets add on some random effect terms
glmmTMB(y ~ x + (1|g), data=data) 
# each group level has its own intercept 
# here we estimate the intercept and slope of the fixed effect term and 
# intercept for the group levels 
# in addition, a correlation is estimated for the random effect term

## Add 
glmmTMB(y ~ x + (x|g), data=data) # each group level has its own intercept and slope.
